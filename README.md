# hyfortune

hyfortune is a fortune cookie generator written in hy, inspired by [please](https://github.com/NayamAmarshe/please) with the task generation part stripped out.

Mostly for my own amusement, so no installation, tests, etc. at the moment. The source code is pretty short so you can just kind of sus out the configuration file if needed. This was primarily for me to tinker around with hy.

TODO:

- [ ] add in indirect call to fortune to get nicer quotes(?)
- [ ] right now, uses please's config file, should generate own
